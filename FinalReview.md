# Number 1: My Data
The data I have chosen is about how women are represented in the news. 
I hope to use the data and create visual that can help the readers easily understand and view how women representation has occurred & changed overtime. Because the representation of women in headlines is majorly in form of texts (Newspapers and Magazines) or Audio (News Channels, podcasts), a good database and an informative visual can help the viewers to accurately understand how women continue to be represented.
I hope to depict representations across different regions or countries, the polarity (positive or negative) and the biases still present in the news selling industry.

# Number 2: The outline
- The Title
- Data Visuals each signifying the bias present in the news industry (Incorporating a storyline)
- A conclusion / Ending my story?

# Number 3: Tools
Data Visualization: Tableau (Link)
Presentation: Shorthand

# Number 4: The content
- *The title: Making the cut – (Mis)Representation of women in the news*
- *The visuals:*

### Visual 1: Word-cloud
#### Most common words associate with the word Women (and similar words like lady etc.) in the news.*
I thought of creating a word cloud of the most common words that are associated with the word women. It is intended to make an introduction to the topic and to show an introductory bias. 





*Diving-into the data!*

### Visual 2: Bar-graph
#### Bucketing the above words into categories + Percentage distribution of the words across categories (% of total) 
- The thought is to categorize these above given words in large buckets such as stereotypes, Crime & Violence, Race, and Identity, to give an easy interpretation of the categories of words that are commonly associated with women.




### Visual 3: Line-chart
##### SENSATIONALIZING women-oriented news
- This visual is to compare the polarity index (Calculated as extreme positive or negative news), to all the news versus news that are associated with women. Hence a simple line graph across the years would give a good overall insight.

### Visual 4: Scatterplot
#### How do famous news outlets compare to each other? (Indicates how is the news sold out to globe)
- The visualization compares the polarity index of all the news versus news that are associated with women, across different news outlets . Hence, the scatter plot will allow us to see that most of the news-outlets that sell majority of news, fall into the category of having a higher women-polarized news as compared to the others.


#### *Conclusion*
### Visual 5: Line-chart
#### How has it changed over the years? Is it really even changing?
- This seems to be the last visual of our storyline which aims to show the average number of times categorized or polarized words are being used for women. It’ll track the trend over the years and see whether there is a change or not.
