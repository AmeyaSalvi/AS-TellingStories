# Number 1: My Data
The data I have chosen is about how women are represented in the news. 
I hope to use the data and create visual that can help the readers easily understand and view how women representation has occurred & changed overtime. Because the representation of women in headlines is majorly in form of texts (Newspapers and Magazines) or Audio (News Channels, podcasts), a good database and an informative visual can help the viewers to accurately understand how women continue to be represented.
I hope to depict representations across different regions or countries, the polarity (positive or negative) and the biases still present in the news selling industry.

### *Introducing the audience* :speech_balloon:
## Visual 1: Word-cloud
### Most common words associate with the word Women (and similar words like lady etc.) in the news.
> I thought of creating a word cloud of the most common words that are associated with the word women. It is intended to make an introduction to the topic and to show an introductory bias.

### *Diving-into the story!* :sweat_drops:
## Visual 2: Bar-graph
### Bucketing the above words into categories + Percentage distribution of the words across categories (% of total) 
> The thought is to categorize these above given words in large buckets such as stereotypes, Crime & Violence, Race, and Identity, to give an easy interpretation of the categories of words that are commonly associated with women.

## Visual 3: Line-chart
### SENSATIONALIZING women-oriented news
> This visual is to compare the polarity index (Calculated as extreme positive or negative news), to all the news versus news that are associated with women. Hence a simple line graph across the years would give a good overall insight.

## Visual 4: Scatterplot
### How do famous news outlets compare to each other? (Indicates how is the news sold out to globe)
> The visualization compares the polarity index of all the news versus news that are associated with women, across different news outlets . Hence, the scatter plot will allow us to see that most of the news-outlets that sell majority of news, fall into the category of having a higher women-polarized news as compared to the others.

### *Conclusion* :man_technologist:
## Visual 5: Line-chart
### How has it changed over the years? Is it really even changing?
> This seems to be the last visual of our storyline which aims to show the average number of times categorized or polarized words are being used for women. It’ll track the trend over the years and see whether there is a change or not.

Title: Making the cut – (Mis)Representation of women in the news

Introduction: 
Women were found to make up just 24% of news subjects and sources reported.

So, if women are underrepresented in the news to begin with, what does it look like when women do make headlines? 
And how have headlines about women changed over time?

We began with seeing the most common words that are associated with the word women (and other similar words such as lady, daughter etc.), repeatedly used worldwide across all global platforms. 

<img width="452" alt="P1" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43436738/155035942-bc1bec5d-baa2-406c-8947-75fe226d0587.png">

Yes, you must notice that most of the words that have been used here would fall under the categories of either Female Stereotyping, associating women with a particular race/identity or selling out news associated with crime and violence.
Here is the distribution for the same. We see most of the words fall under the Female stereotyping bracket followed by the categories of Empowerment, Crime, and Identity.

<img width="401" alt="P2" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43436738/155036652-df51c64e-7034-495c-85a8-0043c171fed6.png">
<img width="402" alt="P3" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43436738/155036663-af1ff6da-8386-4159-baff-9285932e9657.png">

But this makes me wonder is the news sensationalism prominent in women-focused headlines? 
If the news is positive or extremely negative, it is considered sensational, and hence it is given a higher polarity score. As it turns out, not only is sensationalism on the rise, but it has also been consistently higher in headlines with keywords associated with women, as opposed to headlines about other topics.

<img width="452" alt="P4" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43436738/155036666-c084be76-125a-4a7f-867c-9ac4f3574f0e.png">

This also makes me wonder, how do different news outlets compare to each other? Hence, here I compare the countries USA, UK , India & South Africa, and try mapping the polarity for all news v/s women-oriented news. A seen a chunk of the cluster has their polarity higher for women as compared to the rest.

<img width="416" alt="P5" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43436738/155036680-bdc75496-98d9-4b4c-bdd4-b878acade179.png">

As seen, most of the top news companies have a high average polarity for women as compared to the others.

Has the usage of words used in headlines about women have changed over time? 
Thus, we look at the average number of times categorized words are used across the years.

<img width="479" alt="P6" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43436738/155036692-0ca29c76-d3be-40d5-bb65-96b5f7886183.png">

Nonetheless, this visual essay also suggests that some progress has been made. 

Over time, especially post 2019 we see that the use of some gender stereotypes has plummeted. Let’s hope this trend continues and, in the meantime, enjoy our news with a little grain of salt.


# User Research
> Target audience for my story:
Being a woman, this topic is something I thought that really caught my eye. In my opinion, biases present against women in every industry is a subject matter of concern. The news industry is one massive source and medium to create, depict and inform stories, news & facts to people and connect them across the globe. Hence creating visualizations depicting the bias in this industry, should/could be a topic of interest to basically all individuals. 

> My approach to identify representative individuals to interview:
I hoped to identify different individuals to review my rough sketches/visuals, with an aim to receive different perspectives of my sketch attempts and also to gain different insights on what could be done better. 
The 3 individuals I interviewed were:
1.	Student (Fellow CMU buddy)
2.	An acquaintance who works in the news/media Industry
3.	A colleague who leads the Data Visualization team

> Interview script:
1.	Can you tell me what do you think this is?
2.	What can you take out form these visualizations?
3.	Is there a story that you see?
4.	How impactful are the visuals in conveying the intended matter of concern?
5.	Is there anything else you would want to see? If yes, what?
6.	Is there a good flow from one visual to other or does it leave you confused?
7.	Overall, is the entire storyline impactful enough?

> Findings from my interviews:
My findings:
The responses from my interviews me to work on the following:
1.	**The introductory % fact**: The initial fact of 24% of women being represented in the news could be indicted as an infographic rather than a statement, for more visual impact.
2.	**The story-line flow**: Overall response for the flow of the story was good, but the responses probably indicated that it could be better. Moving from one visual to other could be smoother and more informative.
3.	**The Data Visual explanation**: The explanation or description for the visuals could be stronger and more informative, so that it takes lesser time for the audience to grasp and understand what the visual want to say.
4.	**Conclusion visual**: There is one conclusion visual which shows the reduction in the 
e biases present in the industry. Additionally, could there be some other impactful conclusional visual too?

> Changes you plan on implementing to your visualizations next week to address the issues identified. 
- Finding more content on the conclusion: Creating a good visual to summarise the intended topic
- Work on the current visuals to establish a better story-flow
- Improve the current visual explanation so that the audience grasps it quicker
- Create another visualization that Indicates how much % of news are associated with women (rather than stating it just as a fact)
