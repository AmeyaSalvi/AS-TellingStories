## Welcome to my Portfolio!

# About me
Hello folks! I'm Ameya Salvi, a part of the MISM-BIDA program & welcome to my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data! 
While I'm extremely passionate about Data & Visuals, I'm strive to develop on the best practices and exploring my own personal style 
:smiley:

# What I hope to learn 
While traditional education typically draws a distinct line between creative storytelling and technical analysis, the modern professional world also values those who can cross between the two: data visualization sits right in the middle of analysis and visual storytelling. Thus, I hope to dwell upon the saying: *storytelling with a purpose*

My aim is to master the skill of _visual art_ that grabs our interest and keeps our eyes on the message. 
While we know that the data and the visuals need to work together, I attempt everday is to master the art of combining great analysis with great storytelling.
