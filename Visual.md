## _Visual number 1: Visualizing government debt_

> ## Part 1: Working with web-based visualization tools and data
Here, we use the OECD's General government debt data and analyse the given featured visualization. The visual looks like:

> ## Part 2: Working with Flourish: Sparklines
 Here, we make use of an open-source online tool called Flourish, and create a sparkline visualization. This visual allows us to compare the Debt-to-GDP trend across years and across diffrent countries, as well. The visual looks like the below: 
 
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/8558657"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>


> ## Part 3: Working with Flourish: Bubble chart
Here, using Flourish, I have created a bubble visualization. The comparison is across different countries and years, where the years have been indicated by different bubbles.
The visual looks like the below:

# _Synopsis:_
## _Different methods of visualization: Comparison_ 
1. The *first visualization* is a simple bar chart which compares the GDP-to-debt value across different counties for the year 2018. As seen, the majority of the bars are coloued as pale blue, and the top 5 contributers to the GDP (in terms of %) are coloured. Although this representation is not clearly udnerstood in the first look. Additionally, since there is only the year '2018' involved, the comparison across the years is not possible.
2. The *second visualization* is a spark line, where the GDP-to-debt value is represented across different years as a timeline. Additionally, there are diffrent sparklines for each country. The sparkline graph seems good for compare the ratio for an individual country across years. However, if one needs to compare the GDP-to-debt values across different countries, the visual probably makes it difficuly for comparison. Also, the title here is missing which is crucial for the visual.
3. The *third visualization* looks a version of a Bubble chart. Here, the visual is divided with diffreent countries (the Y-axis) and the X-axis represents the GDP-to-debt values. The different bubble-colours here, represent the years. Additionally, the bubble sizes vary in accordance to the GDP-to-debt values. The chart here, allows us to compare different countries across different years, simultaneously. Also, the choice of green colour went well with the representation of the GDP values.
