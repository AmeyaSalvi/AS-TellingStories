## Final Project: Women making the news

### The Initial Steps: 
> ## Step 1: The outline:
#### Summary: I decided on working on the data which I could really personally reflect on and could be personally passionate about. Hence, the topic that I'm eager to visualize and gain more insights about is:

_How are women represnted in the news?_
#### Today, research has suggested that women are significantly less likely to make the news compared to men. In the most recent report published by the Global Media Monitoring Project (GMMP), the largest and longest running research on gender in the worldâ€™s news media, women were found to make up just 24% of news subjects and sources reported. According to this report, this number has not changed since 2010. 

_So, if women are underrepresented in the news to begin with, what does it look like when women do make headlines? 
And how have headlines about women changed over time?_

> ## Step 2: The Data:
### Using the data:
I hope to use the data and create visual that can help the readers easily understand and view how women representation has occurred & changed overtime. Because the representation of women in headlines is majorly in form of texts (Newspapers and Magazines) or Audio (News Channels, podcasts), a really good database and an informative visual can help the viewers to accurately understand how women continue to be represented. I hope to depict representations across different regions or countries, the polarity (positive or negative) and the biases still present in the news selling industry.
