# * _Utlizing Part 1 & Part 2:_
### 1.	Using Part 1: (Rough visuals)

-	The initial sketches that I created in part1 formed the base of the visualisations that had to created.
- The data and visuals were surrounded around the data associated with Women biases around the news and I was hoping to capture the same.
-	The visual skeleton of the data visualizations that were supposed to be created gave me a really good insight on setting up a base for creating a story.

### 2.	Using part 2: (Initial Tableau visuals and Raw Data-story)

- By sketching some of the raw visuals in part 1, I realised what story I wanted to create.
-	I realized in the Part 2, I wanted the story to be surrounded around the topic of Misrepresentation and biases of Women In the news.
-	The visualizations I created in tableau, gave me a concrete idea of the story-flow that I envisioned to create.

# * _Creating the shorthand story:_

**1. Creating the Visuals**
- The raw visuals in part 1 and initial visualizations in Part 2 helped me to get an idea of the visualizations I wanted to create. 
- The final Visuals are created in Tableau, which were blended in to create a smooth storyline.

**2. Drafting a Story**
-	The Storyline that was supposed to be created was revolving around the topic of Representation/Misrepresentation of the news. 
-	It was necessary that I created a storyline that conveyed the facts and figures through strong visualizations and also established a smooth transition of various facts that were supposed to be delivered.
-	Shorthand is used to create a final visually impacting storyline.

**3. Changes made since the completion of Part II**

**_a)	The colours used for the visuals:_**
-	As per the recommendations and reviews: I worked on the colour scheme of certain visualizations and tried to choose the colours that seemed inclusive to the kind of topic I was choosing to represent.
- The colours that were chosen were cohesively tie the visuals each other rand the story.
-	I tried to use less of variation in the colour tones, to stay on topic and not distract the users from the synopsis of the topic that I wanted to convey.

**b)	Creating a more engaging and appealing storyline:**
-	There were some elements that tied together, and some didnâ€™t.
-	Hence, as per part 2 assignment recommendations, I wanted to build a storyline that was seamless and easy to understand and that tied well with the visuals.
-	Thus, I replaced some parts of the raw storyboard and added some more understandable and impactful story elements.

**c)	Incorporating interviews and reviews adaptation**
-	The responses I received were used in creating a cohesive storyline for audience of every type.
-	I realized that some essential definitions and descriptions were missing from my storyboard that needed to be included to give a clearer idea of the content that was being showed.
-	There were several ideas that were not distinctively conceptualized which created unclear concepts for the audiences from different backgrounds.

**d)	Identification as the audience for the final data story**
-	There is an open audience for this content because it is intended to educate the audience about the disparity present in the news associated with women and other news.
-	Hence, I wanted every user/reader to take out insights on what I want to convey.
-	Additionally, I wanted to associate my intended storyline to the audience who work in the news, media, and entertainment industry with an intent that the audience becomes aware of the disparity present and becomes more aware and mindful of their actions.\

# * _Design decisions: (Shorthand)_
###  Number 1: I wanted to create some interesting infographics and visuals that can grab user attention, for example:
### a) Infograph represnting the 25% of the news representation.
**Here, I tried created this infographic using canva that gives an illusion of 1/4th of the newspaper being torn.**

### b) Infograph represnting a country flag represntation.
**I tried creating a infographic synopsis of the insights of the polarity scatter plot on the right:**

###  Number 2: Defining certain metrics used in my visuals:
** I definde and explained the different metrics sued in my visuals for simplicity (Eg. polarity and sensationalism).

###  Number 3: Framing a strong call for action:
** I tried curating certain links that would potentially help in accessing the most authentic and real form of women oriented news, which encourage and voice strong, empowered voices.
