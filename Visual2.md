## _Task number 2: Critique by Design_

### Here, we choose, review and critique a visualization!

> ## Step 1: The original visualization
### The visual chosen is as shown below:

> ## Step 2: My process for re-visualization

1. Changing the title
The current heading 'Every country has a higher life expectancy than in 1800' fails to correlate the two important measured values used here for comparison: The GDP and Life-expectancy. Currently, the only interpretation that can come out of this title refers to the life-expectancy. 

2. Choosing the correct visual
Personally, I thought there could be some other way in comparing the two measured values of GDP and life expectancy other than the scatter plot. The visual I chose was the geographical map. Personally, I thought it is important for the reader to easily map the countries and compare their values across the two years. Since, it's a map spotting the required countries to compare would be easy. 

3. Representation of the GDP: The Bubbles on the Geo-graph
The Bubbles of on the graph would be a similar representation of the scatter-plot. The bubble size would indicate the GDP across the years, hence as assumed the year 1800 would have smaller sizes as compared to the year 2015. 

4. Representation of the Life-Expectancy: The colors of the Bubbles
My approach was the divide the life-expectancy in hyeras in terms of age buckets, with each bucket being representated by a seperate colour. My aim was to represent different age brackets as colours, so that visually interpretation becomes easy, and comparison of years lived across the two years can be visually mapped easily.

5. Representation of population: The background colour of the map
In the scatter pot, the represntation of the population was indicated with a colour, which blocked other countries and dominated the chart. I thought that a use of a single gradient colour as a background for the map will also be a simple and good indicator. A deeper hue could be an indicator of higher population and subsequently a lighter hue 
represents lesser population. This way, the reader wouldn't be confused and distracted from the visual.
